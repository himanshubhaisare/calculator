#Description

Simple Calculator. Performs simple binary operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide.

Also performs combination of binary operations such as 1 + 1 - 4 * 4

Converts the infix expression to it's postfix equivalent and then evaluates it.

Order of preference for the operators is such as the multiplication, division and modulus are 

processed first and then addition, subtraction

#Requirements

足 handle binary operations, e.g. 5 - 6

足 handle combinations of binary combinations, e.g. 1 + 1 - 4 * 4

足 take associativity into account, first process multiplication, division and modulus, then addition

and subtraction

足 no need to handle parentheses, e.g. ( 1 + 1 - 4 ) * 4
