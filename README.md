#Description

Your assignment is to write a calculator script. You do not need to provide an interface to the

program, like a commandline or web interface. So don’t loose time on parsing input in any way or

processing web forms.

You are supposed to take no more than an hour to an hour and a half to complete the test. Do

not use more time as you are not supposed to make it actually work but rather provide a starting

point for a discussion. Pay close attention to the extensibility of your code!

#Requirements

and subtraction

­ no need to handle parentheses, e.g. ( 1 + 1 - 4 ) * 4

#Objectives

­ demonstrate skills in OOP code design

­ showcase development best practices

­ demonstrate good algorithmic thinking

­ communication skills in discussing code implementations and vision

­ demonstrate insight in how code evolves over time
